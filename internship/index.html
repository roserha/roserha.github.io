                                        During my time working at the National Checking Company, I was a <i>Software Development Intern</i> working alongisde the <i>Always Food Safe</i> team to bring improvements to our Learning Management System
                                        platform.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        NCCO as a whole has around 51-200 employees company-wide, and the office I worked at has 6-13 employees, and I was one of 3 interns company-wide, and the only intern at the office. NCCO is a 150-yo company whose purpose and passion is to
                                        "create simple and relevant solutions to seemingly irrelevant and often unrealized problems".
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        My LMS team has a Software Engineering Manager, two Senior Software Engineers, and a Software Engineer. During my internship, one of the Senior Engineers and the Software Engineer made themselves
                                        available to mentor me and answer any questions that arose.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Utilizing Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, Wrike, Microsoft Teams and Outlook, we were able to organize our work efforts and collaborate towards development, utilizing languages/frameworks such as ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript, jQuery, Transact-SQL, and HTML+CSS.

                                        As of writing, I worked on around <b>9</b> different projects inside AFS, all approaching different aspects of our LMS. Keeping details as vague but as detailed as possible (no NDA breaches here!), here are some of the elements I worked on:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Improved file uploads and implemented file restrictions</li>
                                        <li>Added/fixed localizations across multiple services</li>
                                        <li>API scalability improvements</li>
                                        <li>Unit test implementations</li>
                                        <li>Technological debt work</li>
                                        <li>New feature additions to multiple aspects of LMS + QOL improvements to:</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Admin functionalities (such as user management and exam informations)</li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <p>In total, across more than ten pull requests, I programmed over one-thousand lines of peer-reviewed code.</p>
